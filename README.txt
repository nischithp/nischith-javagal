# Nischith's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio website's Readme!

# Description
I've used this website to let potential employers know my skill and serve as a showcase of my previous work and interests in the world of Software Development and Computer Science. 
I plan to integrate a blog in the future to be able to express my opinions and for this space to serve as a place which holds my dearest memories of life events I've recorded.
